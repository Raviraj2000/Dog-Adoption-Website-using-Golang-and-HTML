# Woof
\
\
There are around 30 million stray dogs in India. They live in the worst of conditions without any food or water for weeks all together. 
\
\
With our project we strive to create a platform all those kind-hearted people who wish to adopt these lovely animals. By bringing the process of dog adoption online with the help of a fully functional website we tend to bridge the gap between a thought and reality. 
\
\
Our main goal while creating ‘Woof’ was to create a platform so simple that the entire process would be like hot knife through butter. 
\
\
On the first Page people can learn about our goal and initiative. They can also find a form to contact us if they have any doubts. 
\
\
In the ‘Adoption’ Section we display the details of all the dogs currently in our shelter. If the user likes any one of the dogs he/she can fill out an application form and a request will be added in our database. After reviewing the adopters details the people from woof will contact the adopter for further details. 
\
\
We also want to create a medium where people can give up dogs for adoption. We added a ‘Place for Adoption’ Section on our website. Here anybody can fill out a form along with a picture of the dog they want to give up for adoption. Again, the details along with picture of the dog will be added to our database and the concerned person will contacted.
